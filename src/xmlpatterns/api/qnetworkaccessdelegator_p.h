     * @short A value based class that hands out QNetworkAccessManager
     * appropriately for variable bindings.
     *
     * NetworkAccessDelegator is an indirection mechanism which takes care of
     * the fact that QIODevice instances are injected into the data model by
     * having them represented using a URI. managerFor() returns appropriately
     * the right network access manager depending on whether the URI refers to
     * a variable, or to something else.
     *
     * The constructor take a pointer to two NetworkAccessDelegator instances.
     * First is a generic one, the second is the one which handles variable
     * bindings. managerFor() then returns the appropriate one depending on the
     * URI.
